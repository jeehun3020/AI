🧠 AI & Deep Learning Learning Repository

A collection of machine learning and deep learning implementations, experiments, and practice projects.
This repository serves as my ongoing study log as I explore various AI models, algorithms, and frameworks.

I aim to build a strong foundation in both classical ML and modern deep learning by implementing models from scratch, training them on real datasets, and comparing their performance.
📚 What’s Inside

This repository is organized into branches, each dedicated to a specific concept or model:

🔹 AdaBoost

Implementation of Adaptive Boosting for binary classification tasks.
Includes intuition, weak learners, and visualization of boosting effects.

🔹 DecisionTree

Decision tree model built from scratch with entropy, Gini index, and pruning logic.
Includes visualization of decision boundaries and performance comparisons.

🔹 GAN

Generative Adversarial Networks implemented using PyTorch/TensorFlow.
Contains generator–discriminator training loops and experiments with image generation.

🔹 GenerativeAI

Exploration of large language models, prompt engineering, and generative AI applications.
Includes projects using LLMs, LangChain, and text generation workflows.

🔹 Gradio

Interactive AI demos built using Gradio interfaces.
Useful for quickly deploying and testing ML models in a browser.

🔹 Transformer

Transformer-based NLP models including BERT-encoder pipelines,
custom decoder architectures, and IMDB sentiment analysis experiments.
